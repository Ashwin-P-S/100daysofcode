# Simple Pendulum

Write a program to input a list of integers in an array and arrange them in a way similar to the to-and-fro movement of a Pendulum:

- The minimum element out of the list of integers, must come in center position of array.
- The number in the ascending order next to the minimum, goes to the right, the next higher number goes to the left of minimum number and it continues.
- As higher numbers are reached, one goes to one side in a to-and-fro manner similar to that of a Pendulum.
